    <h3> Information about Breast Cancer:</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions are unusual growths or other changes<br>
                                   in the breast tissue that are not cancer. Having a benign breast condition can<br>
                                   be scary at first because the symptoms often mimic those caused by breast cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Malignant Tumors: Cancerous. Once breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, the cancer<br>
                                                  cells can travel to other areas of the body, like the liver or bones.<br>
                                                   The breast cancer cells can then form tumors in those locations. A biopsy<br>
                                                    of these tumors might show characteristics of the original breast cancer tumor.</p>
